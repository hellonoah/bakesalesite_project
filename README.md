### about
Copy:
Bakesale Betty was created by Australian cook, Alison Barakat. Since Alison moved to the States in 2000, she has been baking delicious treats that are reminiscent of the ones she grew up eating.

Alison's passion for food and regard for using the best ingredients make her unique cakes and sweets divine. Alison began selling her baked goods at the Danville Farmers' Market where she met her husband Michael Camp.

Together Alison and Michael opened their first retail bakery shop in North Oakland's Temescal District. More recently they have expanded their location to Oaklandâ€™s Downtown District on West Grand and Broadway.
