BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH
For the Vinaigrette:
1 tablespoon Dijon Mustard
3 tablespoons Red Wine Vinegar
1 teaspoon Salt
1/2 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
For the Coleslaw:
1 small Red Onion (sliced very thin)
1/2 cup Red Wine Vinegar
2 Jalapeno Chiles (cut in half lengthwise; sliced crosswise)
1/4 cup chopped Parsley
1/2 Green Cabbage (core and outer leaves removed; sliced very thin)
1 teaspoon Salt
For the Chicken:
4 large Skinless Boneless Chicken Breast Halves (about 6 ounces each)
Salt to taste
1/2 quart Buttermilk
4 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour
1 tablespoon Cayenne Pepper
1 tablespoon Salt
1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground Black Pepper
2 quarts Vegetable Oil (for frying)
4 fresh Sweet White Rolls (sliced lengthwise)

step-by-step directions
For the Vinaigrette: In a bowl, whisk the mustard, vinegar, and salt. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until well blended. Set aside.
For the Coleslaw: In a small bowl, cover sliced onions with red wine vinegar, allowing to macerate for 5 minutes. Drain off vinegar, discard and add onions to a medium mixing bowl along with cabbage, parsley, jalapenos, salt and enough vinaigrette to moisten. Combine all ingredients and adjust seasoning.
For the Chicken: Season the chicken breasts with salt. Let stand at least 5 minutes. Pour buttermilk over chicken breasts and allow to sit for anywhere between 1 hour and overnight.
Pour the vegetable oil into a large pot, filling it no more than halfway. Place the pot on a burner over med heat until the oil temperature reaches 325°F.
Combine flour, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper in a wide, shallow dish.  Remove chicken breast from buttermilk, one at a time, without wiping any excess buttermilk and place in seasoned flour.  Coat both sides with seasoned flour, shake off excess and dip back into buttermilk.  Repeat the flour coating process, this will produce a thicker, crunchier coating on the chicken. Repeat with remaining breasts.
Carefully place each piece of chicken in the hot oil using tongs.  After a minute, using tongs, make sure the chicken breasts are cooking evenly and not sticking to one another.  Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and golden and crispy.  Drain on paper towels and allow to cool a few minutes before assembling the sandwich.
Top each bottom half of the rolls with a generous amount coleslaw.  Place a chicken breast on top and finish with the top half of the roll. Cut sandwich in half and enjoy!

Bakesale Betty was created by Australian cook, Alison Barakat. Since Alison moved to the States in 2000, she has been baking delicious treats that are reminiscent of the ones she grew up eating.

Alison's passion for food and regard for using the best ingredients make her unique cakes and sweets divine. Alison began selling her baked goods at the Danville Farmers' Market where she met her husband Michael Camp.

Together Alison and Michael opened their first retail bakery shop in North Oakland's Temescal District. More recently they have expanded their location to Oakland’s Downtown District on West Grand and Broadway.


### jingle
Currently there is a single page dedicated to the the jingle. There are other useful applications for having music in the site. This could function as a media sound instead of a dedicated page.
